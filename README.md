Responsive Portfolio

This is my Portfolio, it has an "About Me" page, a "Portfolio" page, and a "Contact" information page. Using Bootstap's Javascript and CSS link style sheets, I created the
layouts for my pages.

The Index is my "About Me" page. Giving a small description about myself and links to my
other pages.

The "Portfolio" page has images with small title bars infront of them, using container, row, and colums to keep the images aligned also using margins to keep a nice distance between the images.

The "Contact" page is where you will find my contact informations, with my name and email address. All links are linked together for easier access to each one, from which ever site.
